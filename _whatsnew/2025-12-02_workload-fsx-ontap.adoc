=== Support for AWS S3 access points for FSx for ONTAP
NetApp Workload Factory supports AWS S3 access points for your FSx for ONTAP file systems. You can create volumes using S3 access points, assign S3 access points to an existing volume, and manage S3 access points from the Workload Factory console. Using an S3 access point, you can access file data residing on SMB/CIFS or NFS volumes via the AWS S3 APIs. This allows you to integrate your existing data with GenAI, ML, and analytics from AWS services that support S3 access points.
