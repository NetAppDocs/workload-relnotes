=== Link creation updates    

* Codebox viewer: Codebox is now integrated in the link creation process. You can view and copy the CloudFormation template from Codebox in workload factory before redirecting to AWS to execute the operation.  

* Required permissions: The permissions required to execute the link creation in AWS CloudFormation are now available to view and copy from the Create Link wizard in workload factory.

* Support for manual link creation: This feature allows standalone creation in AWS CloudFormation with manual registration of the link ARN. It's useful when a Security or DevOps team assists in the link creation process.
