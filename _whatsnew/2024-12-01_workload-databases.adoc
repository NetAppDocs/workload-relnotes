=== Continuous optimization adds compute remediation and assessment 
Databases now provides insights and recommendations to help you optimize compute resources for Microsoft SQL Server instances. We measure CPU utilization and leverage the AWS Compute Optimizer service to recommend optimal right-sized instance types and notify you of available operating system patches. Optimizing compute resources can help you make informed decisions about instance types, leading to cost savings and efficient resource utilization.
