=== Read mode support for storage management
Read mode is available for storage management in workload factory. Read mode enhances the experience of basic mode by adding read-only permissions so that the Infrastructure-as-Code templates are filled with your specific variables. The Infrastructure-as-Code templates can be executed directly from your AWS account without providing any modify permissions to workload factory.
